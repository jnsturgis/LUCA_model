# Branch Information #

* main      - the main branch for merging other bits into.
* fba       - tools for building an appropriate objective function based on
              active parts of metabolism and required co-factors and initial
              concentrations. Also, and related, analysis of fba failures (what
              required species are not available and why) **fba.py**
* analysis  - Analysis of used and unused parts of the metabolism and
              thermodynamic choke points in the flux model.
* anabolism - develop separate anabolism model files.
* catabolism - develop separate catabolism model files.
* external  - develop tools for automatically recovering pertinent information
              from external databases - reactions, species, adjust pH for
              thermodynamic parameters.
* genetics  - improve catabolic model by semi-automatically adding genes so
              deletion studies are possible.
* reactions - add extra reactions for other parts that might/will be needed
              unwrap oleate biosynthesis and add quinones etc. (as far as
              possible, use scripts)
* documentation - Set up an write documentation for the project, both the Sphinx
              documentation and the presentation documentation.
