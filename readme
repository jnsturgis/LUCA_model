## LUCA.sbml

THe objective of this project is to build a self consistent metabolic model of LUCA, 
that is coherent with as many as possible of the accepted and likely properties of LUCA.

The model sbml file will contain the model however a number of accessory programs should
be associated with the project in order to:
* Help maintain coherency and consistency of the model. 
* Allow automatic recovery of information and annotations for the model from different
on-line sources.
* Produce figures based on the model

The main model will contain the anabolic reactions necessary for growth of the model
organism, as analysed by flux balance analysis, and the exchange reactions with the
environment needed for resource acquisition and waste disposal.
A separate part of the model will deal with catabolic reactions and the possible sources
of ATP.

The initial model LUCA_v0.0.sbml was generated automatically from the tables Witters et al. (1)
using the script in table2sbml.py
