This directory contains a metabolic model of LUCA. 
This model aims to be as complete as possible and provide a self consistent metabolism and objective functions for analysis.
Various choices will be necessary and explained here in the development of the model that is based on the article by Wimmer et al. 2021 (Energy at Origins: Favorable Thermodynamics of Biosynthetic Reactions in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) Frontiers in Microbiology 12:793664 doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.793664)

The objective with this metabolic model is to be able to then propose an evolutionary path from earlier models while maintaining a coherent metabolic and catalytic scheme.

Step 1 Convert Wimmers model to an smbl model this is LUCA_clean.sbml that was created by the python code in ../Tables2SBML.ipynb convert to pure python code but fetching external info seems to be imperfect.

Step 2 Convert to a model suitable for FBA and a metabolic model:
	1. Need an objective function so add DNA, RNA, Protein, Membrane and cofactors to define the composition of LUCA. This needs some decisions!
	2. Need to define a catabolism to drive the anabolism and merge with the anabolic reations. This needs some decisions.
	3. Need to define exchanges with the environment to provide raw materials.

1.1 Following Jain et al. 2014 propose a membrane composed of a mixture of polyprenyl ether lipids on glycerol-1-phosphate and fatty acyl ester lipids on glycerol-3-phosphate forming a heterochiral membrane. These then have head groups added by the CDP route including serine, ethanolamine and glycerol.

1.2 Following from bionumbers (BNID 111490) and derived from Niedhardt et al. the composition of the cell (recalculated to remove LPS, peptidoglycan and glycogen) is about:
Protein 60% dry wt
RNA 22%
DNA 3%
Lipids 10%
Metabolites and cofactors 4%
Ions 1%

1.3 Within these we will opt for DNA and RNA 55%GC and 45%AT (an arbitrary choice)

1.4 Proteome composition based on data in Brune et al 2018.
