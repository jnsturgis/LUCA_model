# LUCA_model project

The primary objective of this project is to build a self consistent metabolic
model of LUCA, coded as an SBML file.
The model should be coherent with as many as possible of the accepted and
likely properties of LUCA.
Furthermore, the model should be functional in as far as allowing a
flux-balance-analysis solution with an objective function representing a
reasonable cellular content, including fabrication of all necessary cofactors
and coenzymes, with exchange reactions representing a plausible LUCA_environment
for LUCA.

Beyond the SBML model the project will include and require a number of
accessory programs that will:

* Help maintain coherency and consistency of the model.
* Allow automatic recovery of information and annotations for the model from
different on-line sources.
* Facilitate building the model from different parts
* Produce figures and tables based on the model

The initial model LUCA_v0.0.sbml was generated automatically from the tables
Witters et al. (1).
