"""
This file describes a metabolic network class and ancillary functions.

The objective of this work is to build whole organism (or meta-organism)
metabolic models and study how these can evolve and adapt to different
conditions.

In this file and the associated class we will try to adhere to the following
scheme.

Instance methods of the class modify the data.
Class methods operate on the class or are alternatice constructors
Standalone functions operate with multiple instances or are very generic.
