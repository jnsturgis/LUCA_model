Data files
==========

The different models have been produced from several data tables and pieces of
information. These tables and the data is found here and explained.

Parametrization
----------------

* `Bionumbers_concentrations.csv` File with steady state concentrations of various
   metabolites and ions, based on E. coli.
*  `235-t1-IonConcentrations-11.png` Image from Bionumbers with Ion concentrations
   these are included in the csv file.
*  `240-t1-MetabolitesConc-13.png` Image from Bionumbers with metabolite concentrations
   these are included in the csv file.

This information formed the basis of the initial concentrations for Metabolites,
and the development of the biomass function.

Data tables for pathways
------------------------

From article
#############

The initial data tables for LUCA_v0.0.sbml were taken from the article by
Wimmers. This data is here as

*  LUCAcompounds_v0.0.csv and
*  LUCAreactions_v0.0.csv

Fatty acid Biosynthesis
#######################

``FAB_compound.csv`` and ``FAB_reaction.csv`` contain the data for producing the
fatty acid bioynthesis pathway.

Wood Ljungdahl pathway
######################
``WL_compound.csv`` and ``WL_reaction.csv`` contain the data for producing the
Wood-Ljungdahl carbon assimilation pathway.
